# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?</b> 
  I care about the environment, and the looming effects of Global Warming.</b>
  I care about our failing healthcare system.
What do you know about?</b>
  I know that we are running out of time to heal the planet.</b>
  I know that our current healthcare system is NOT working. 
What decisions do you face?</b>
  Where I would live if Florida went under water.</b>
  What I would do if I couldn't afford to pay for health insurance. How would I care for my family without it?
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation</b>
  The data could show climate impact variations for different countries, states or even cities!</b>
  There are different costs of healthcare globally. It is believed free healthcare like in Sweden is the best decision. 
2. Trend related to the news</b>
  There are news articles out about climate change, and what would happen if we continue to ignore scientists' warnings.</b>
  Free healthcare in the US is a hot political topic.
3. Who does that?</b>
  I believe anyone concerned with the environment's health could use my data to understand what is happening. </b>
  US citizens are divided on healthcare for all vs. the current private payer system.
4. Answering a question people care about</b>
  My research will most likely help the naysayers understand in lamens terms why climate change is real. </b>
  My research will help to prove if healthcare for all is a good or bad idea.
5. Valuable to businesses</b>
  I don't believe this would make anyone money, but it could trigger them to contribute to saving the planet.</b>
  I believe in the end, businesses will benefit imensly financially if healthcare were to be a right, not a privelege. 
6. What's the most popular?</b>
  I don't think this template applies to climate change.</b>
  People would be able to log in, and see if the healthcare for all would TRULY be good, or not. 
7. Cost/Money rankings</b>
  It'll cost us all of our lives if we don't do something. </b>
  Healthcare insurance companies make all of the money! 
## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?</b>
  They don't believe in climate change. Maybe they are just confused?</b>
  For some reason, people believe you have to pay to be taken care of, that our country would fall a part if we offered healthcare for
  all. I would love to find out if that is true. 
## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?</b>
  I found an article on FiveThirtyEight about a poll that shows what most people know about religion, and what they don't! 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?</b>
  No, this one is pretty spot on. Maybe flipping the switch and saying religion is lost on new generations.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?</b>
  How do Christians stack up to their religious counterparts?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
  

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
  Government sites or NASA's site! 

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
