# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
  I care about the environment, and the looming effects of Global Warming.
  I care about our failing healthcare system.
What do you know about?
  I know that we are running out of time to heal the planet.
  I know that our current healthcare system is NOT working. 
What decisions do you face?
  Where I would live if Florida went under water.
  What I would do if I couldn't afford to pay for health insurance. How would I care for my family without it?
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  The data could show climate impact variations for different countries, states or even cities!
  There are different costs of healthcare globally. It is believed free healthcare like in Sweden is the best decision. 
2. Trend related to the news
  There are news articles out about climate change, and what would happen if we continue to ignore scientists' warnings.
  Free healthcare in the US is a hot political topic.
3. Who does that?
  I believe anyone concerned with the environment's health could use my data to understand what is happening. 
  US citizens are divided on healthcare for all vs. the current private payer system.
4. Answering a question people care about
  My research will most likely help the naysayers understand in lamens terms why climate change is real. 
  
5. Valuable to businesses
  I don't believe this would make anyone money, but it could trigger them to contribute to saving the planet.
  I believe in the end, businesses will benefit imensly financially if healthcare were to be a right, not a privelege. 
6. What's the most popular?
  I don't think this template applies to climate change.
  People would be able to log in, and see if the healthcare for all would TRULY be good, or not. 
7. Cost/Money rankings
  It'll cost us all of our lives if we don't do something. 
  Healthcare insurance companies make all of the money! 
## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
  They don't believe in climate change. Maybe they are just confused?
  For some reason, people believe you have to pay to be taken care of, that our country would fall a part if we offered healthcare for
  all. I would love to find out if that is true. 
## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
  I found an article on FiveThirtyEight about a poll that shows what most people know about religion, and what they don't! 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
  No, this one is pretty spot on. Maybe flipping the switch and saying religion is lost on new generations.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
  How do Christians stack up to their religious counterparts?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
  

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
  Government sites or NASA's site! 

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
